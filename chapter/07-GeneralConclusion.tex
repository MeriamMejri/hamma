This project represents the culmination of many months of diligent effort, combining technical expertise and strategic planning. Developing an AI-powered tool for Third-Party Risk Management involved overcoming technical challenges while gaining a deep understanding of risk analysis in the digital realm. Given the sensitivity of the task, even minor errors could lead to substantial oversights, underscoring the importance of precision throughout the process.\par

A major accomplishment was the successful integration of AI with no-code platforms like Bubble.io. By leveraging the ChatGPT API, we automated the generation of industry-specific third-party risk assessment questions, enhancing the tool's capacity to deliver dynamic, real-time content. Another achievement was the seamless implementation of backend workflows, ensuring smooth operations without affecting frontend performance. Building a secure framework for user permissions and data integrity allowed the project to fulfill its core objectives of creating a scalable, reliable risk management tool.\par

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges that tested my technical skills while deepening my understanding of AI’s role in cybersecurity. Ensuring scalability while maintaining data security during API integrations was a key challenge. These experiences emphasized the importance of iterative testing and developing a secure, user-friendly platform, sharpening my problem-solving abilities in API management and workflow automation.\par

Looking to the future, the next phase will focus on integrating custom Generative AI models tailored to third-party risk assessment to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce false positives. A specialized dataset addressing risks posed by different third-party groups will allow for more precise analysis. As AI and cybersecurity evolve, the platform will integrate new technologies, ensuring it remains at the forefront of third-party risk management and continues to mitigate cybersecurity threats.\par
